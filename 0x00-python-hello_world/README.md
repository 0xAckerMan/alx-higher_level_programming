## Zen\
```
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

### 0. Run Python file
```
Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.

The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE
```

### 1. Run inline
```
Write a Shell script that runs Python code.

The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE
```

### 2. Hello, print
```
Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.

Use the function print
```

### 3. Print integer
```
Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.

You can find the source code here
The output of the script should be:
the number, followed by Battery street,
followed by a new line
You are not allowed to cast the variable number into a string
Your code must be 3 lines long
You have to use f-strings tips
```

### 4. Print float
```
Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable number with a precision of 2 digits.

You can find the source code here
The output of the program should be:
Float:, followed by the float with only 2 digits
followed by a new line
You are not allowed to cast number to string
You have to use f-strings
```
